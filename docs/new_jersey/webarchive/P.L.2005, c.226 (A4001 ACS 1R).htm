the new economy, as vast quantities of sensitive, personal information are now vulnerable to
criminal interception and misuse; and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>A number of indicators reveal that, despite increased public awareness of the crime,
incidents of identity theft continue to rise; and</span></p>

data or the fraudulent acquisition of credit cards or other financial products in another person's
name; and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>d.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Identity theft is an act that violates the privacy of our citizens and ruins their good
names: victims can suffer restricted access to credit and diminished employment opportunities,
and may spend years repairing damage to credit histories; and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>e.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Credit reporting agencies and issuers of credit should have uniform reporting
requirements and effective fraud alerts to assist identity theft victims in repairing and protecting
their credit; and</span></p>

United States.  Social Security numbers are used for employee files, medical records, health
insurance accounts, credit and banking accounts, university ID cards and many other purposes;
and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>g.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Social Security numbers are frequently used as identification numbers in many computer
files, giving access to information an individual may want kept private and allowing an easy
way of linking data bases. Therefore, it is wise to limit access to an individual's Social Security
number whenever possible; and</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>h.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>It is therefore a valid public purpose for the New Jersey Legislature to ensure that the
Social Security numbers of the citizens of the State of New Jersey are less accessible in order
to detect and prevent identity theft and to enact certain other protections and remedies related
thereto and thereby further the public safety.</span></p>
