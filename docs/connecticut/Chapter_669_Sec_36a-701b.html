Opportunity for hearing.</span> (a)(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, no such license, and no renewal thereof, shall be granted unless the applicant has filed a surety bond with the commissioner written by a surety authorized to write such bonds in this state, provided any applicant that files applications for licenses for more than one location shall file a single bond. Except as provided in this subdivision, for every applicant, the principal amount of the bond shall be the greater of (A) forty thousand dollars, or (B) (i) twice the amount of the average daily balance of the payments received by the applicant from Connecticut debtors in connection with the applicant’s debt adjustment activity during the preceding twelve months ending July thirty-first of each year, or (ii) in the case of an applicant that has acquired the business of a predecessor debt adjuster, the lesser of the amount of the predecessor’s debt adjustment activity during such preceding period or one million dollars. The commissioner may require a larger bond if the commissioner determines that a licensee has engaged in a pattern of conduct resulting in bona fide consumer complaints of misconduct and that such increased bond is necessary for the protection of consumers, or may increase or decrease the amount of the bond based upon the applicant’s or licensee’s financial condition, business plan and the actual or estimated aggregate amount of payments and fees paid by Connecticut debtors to such applicant. Each licensee shall submit to the commissioner, by September first of each year, a report containing information on the average daily balance of the payments received by the licensee from Connecticut debtors during the preceding twelve months ending July thirty-first of each such year. The report shall be subscribed and affirmed as true by the licensee and shall be in a form prescribed by the commissioner.</p>
			<p>(2) If a licensee or applicant for renewal of a license establishes that such licensee or applicant is unable to comply with the bond required by subdivision (1) of this subsection, it shall file a bond for the highest principal amount it can obtain, provided such amount shall be a minimum of forty thousand dollars, and the licensee or applicant for renewal shall, in lieu of the balance of the required amount of the bond, deposit a sum equal to the amount of the bond required by subdivision (1) of this subsection, less the amount of the bond filed with the commissioner, in cash or cash equivalents, with such bank, out-of-state bank that has a branch in this state, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union as such applicant or licensee may designate and the commissioner may approve, and subject to such conditions as the commissioner deems necessary for the protection of consumers and in the public interest. No licensee or applicant shall make such deposit until the depository institution and the licensee or applicant executes a deposit agreement satisfactory to the commissioner. The deposit agreement shall pledge the amount deposited to the commissioner and provide that the depository institution shall not release any of the moneys pledged without the authorization of the commissioner. The amount deposited shall secure the same obligation as would a surety bond filed under this section and shall be held at such banks or credit unions to cover claims during the period the license remains in full force and effect and the succeeding two years after such license has been surrendered, revoked or suspended or has expired. The licensee or applicant may collect interest on such deposit in accordance with its deposit agreement. The deposits made pursuant to this section shall be deemed, by operation of law, to be held in trust for the benefit of any debtor, who may be damaged by failure of a licensee or applicant to perform any written agreements or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid to a licensee in the event of the bankruptcy of the licensee, and shall be immune from attachment by creditors or judgment creditors.</p>
			<p>(3) The form of any surety bond submitted pursuant to this section shall be approved by the Attorney General. Any surety bond filed under this section shall be conditioned upon the licensee faithfully performing any and all written agreements with debtors, truly and faithfully accounting for all funds received by the licensee in the licensee’s capacity as a debt adjuster, and conducting such business consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-655 to 36a-665, inclusive. Any debtor who may be damaged by failure to perform any written agreements, or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid to a licensee, may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed upon the licensee pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50. The proceeds of any bond, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of such claimants against the licensee in the event of bankruptcy of the licensee and shall be immune from attachment by creditors and judgment creditors. Any bond required by this section shall be maintained during the entire period of the license granted to the applicant, and the aggregate liability under any such bond shall not exceed the principal amount of the bond or the limit of liability.</p>
			<p>(b) The surety shall have the right to cancel any bond filed under subsection (a) of this section at any time by a written notice to the licensee, stating the date cancellation shall take effect. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. No such bond shall be cancelled unless the surety notifies the commissioner in writing not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety, the commissioner shall give written notice to the licensee of the date such bond cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the license on such date, unless prior to such date the licensee submits a letter of reinstatement of the bond from the surety or a new bond or the licensee has surrendered the license. After a license has been automatically suspended, the commissioner shall give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51 and require the licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as in the opinion of the commissioner will effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>

Opportunity for hearing.</span> (a) As used in this section and sections 36a-671a to 36a-671e, inclusive, (1) “debt negotiation” means, for or with the expectation of a fee, commission or other valuable consideration, assisting a debtor in negotiating or attempting to negotiate on behalf of a debtor the terms of a debtor’s obligations with one or more mortgagees or creditors of the debtor, including the negotiation of short sales of residential property or foreclosure rescue services; (2) “debtor” means any individual who has incurred indebtedness or owes a debt for personal, family or household purposes; (3) “mortgagee” means the original lender under a mortgage loan secured by residential property or its agents, successors or assigns; (4) “mortgagor” means a debtor who is an owner of residential property, including, but not limited to, a single-family unit in a common interest community, who is also the borrower under a mortgage encumbering such residential property; (5) “short sale” means the sale of residential property by a mortgagor for an amount less than the outstanding balance owed on the loan secured by such property where, prior to the sale, the mortgagee or an assignee of the mortgagee agrees to accept less than the outstanding loan balance in full or partial satisfaction of the mortgage debt and the proceeds of the sale are paid to the mortgagee or an assignee of the mortgagee; (6) “foreclosure rescue services” means services related to or promising assistance in connection with (A) avoiding or delaying actual or anticipated foreclosure proceedings concerning residential property, or (B) curing or otherwise addressing a default or failure to timely pay with respect to a mortgage loan secured by residential property, and includes, but is not limited to, the offer, arrangement or placement of a mortgage loan secured by residential property or other extension of credit when those services are advertised, offered or promoted in the context of foreclosure related services; and (7) “residential property” means one-to-four family owner-occupied real property.</p>
			<p>(b) No person shall engage or offer to engage in debt negotiation in this state without a license issued under this section for each location where debt negotiation will be conducted. Any person desiring to obtain such a license shall file with the commissioner an application under oath, setting forth such information as the commissioner may require. Each applicant for a license and each licensee shall notify the commissioner of any change in the applicant’s business from that stated in the application for the license. A person is engaging in debt negotiation in this state if such person: (1) Has a place of business located within this state; (2) has a place of business located outside of this state and the debtor is a resident of this state who negotiates or agrees to the terms of the services in person, by mail, by telephone or via the Internet; or (3) has its place of business located outside of this state and the services concern a debt that is secured by property located within this state.</p>
			<p>(c) An application for an original or renewal debt negotiation license shall be in writing on a form provided by the commissioner and shall include (1) the history of criminal convictions of the (A) applicant, (B) partners, if the applicant is a partnership, (C) members, if the applicant is a limited liability company or association, or (D) officers, directors and principal employees, if the applicant is a corporation; and (2) sufficient information pertaining to the history of criminal convictions, in a form acceptable to the commissioner, on such applicant, partners, members, officers, directors and principal employees as the commissioner deems necessary to make the findings under subsection (d) of this section. The commissioner, in accordance with section 29-17a, may conduct a state and national criminal history records check of the applicant and of each partner, member, officer, director and principal employee of the applicant. The commissioner may deem an application for a debt negotiation license abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-671 to 36a-671e, inclusive, or any regulations adopted pursuant to said sections 36a-671 to 36a-671e, inclusive. The commissioner shall notify the applicant, in writing, that if the applicant fails to submit such information not later than sixty days after the date on which such request for information was made, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded.

Such debt negotiation license shall not be transferable. Any change of location of a licensee shall require prior written notice to the commissioner. No licensee shall use any name unless such name has been approved by the commissioner. If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license and shall notify the applicant of the reasons for such denial. The commissioner may deny an application if the commissioner finds that the applicant or any partner, member, officer, director or principal employee of the applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor involving any aspect of the debt negotiation business or any felony. Any denial of an application by the commissioner shall, when applicable, be subject to the provisions of section 46a-80. Withdrawal of an application for a license shall become effective upon receipt by the commissioner of a notice of intent to withdraw such application. The commissioner may deny a license up to the date one year after the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
			<p>(e) Each applicant for an original or renewal debt negotiation license shall, at the time of making such application, pay to the commissioner an application fee of one thousand six hundred dollars, provided, if such application is filed not earlier than one year before the date such license will expire, such person shall pay a license fee of eight hundred dollars. Each such license shall expire at the close of business on September thirtieth of the odd-numbered year following its issuance unless such license is renewed. Each licensee shall, on or before September first of the year in which the license expires, file such renewal application as the commissioner may require. Whenever an application for a license is filed under this section by any person who was a licensee under this section and whose license expired less than sixty days prior to the date such application was filed, such application shall be accompanied by a one-hundred-dollar processing fee in addition to the application fee.</p>
			<p>(f) If the commissioner determines that a check filed with the commissioner to pay an application fee has been dishonored, the commissioner shall automatically suspend the license or a renewal license that has been issued but is not yet effective. The commissioner shall give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51.</p>

			<p>(3) Each debt negotiation licensee shall file a single surety bond that complies with the requirements of this section in connection with the main office license with the commissioner in an aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars or such other amount required in subdivision (4) of this subsection, which bond shall identify any licensed branch office as a bonded location on such bond by addendum.</p>
			<p>(4) In the case of a debt negotiation licensee engaging or offering to engage in the business of negotiating residential mortgage loans on behalf of mortgagors, such debt negotiation licensee shall file a bond in the penal sum amount set forth in subsection (e) of this section based on the aggregate dollar amount of the residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated by its sponsored mortgage loan originator licensees. The principal on a bond required by this subdivision shall annually confirm that it maintains the required penal sum in the amount required by this subdivision. Not later than September 1, 2012, and each September first thereafter, a licensee shall file with the commissioner such information as the commissioner may require to confirm that the penal sum of the bond remains consistent with the amount required by this section. The principal shall file not later than September first of the applicable year, or on such other date as the commissioner may require pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, any bond rider or endorsement to the surety bond on file with the commissioner to reflect any changes necessary to maintain the surety bond coverage required by this section.</p>
			<p>(b) The form of any surety bond submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be approved by the Attorney General. Any surety bond filed under subsection (a) of this section shall be conditioned upon the debt negotiation licensee and any sponsored mortgage loan originator licensee faithfully performing any and all written agreements or commitments with or for the benefit of debtors and mortgagors, as applicable, truly and faithfully accounting for all funds received from a debtor or mortgagor by the principal or a mortgage loan originator sponsored by the principal in the principal’s capacity as debt negotiation licensee, and conducting such business consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-485 to 36a-498f, inclusive, 36a-534a, 36a-534b and 36a-671 to 36a-671e, inclusive. Any debtor or mortgagor who may be damaged by a failure to perform any written agreements, by the wrongful conversion of funds paid by a debtor or mortgagor to a debt negotiation licensee or mortgage loan originator licensee, or by conduct inconsistent with the provisions of sections 36a-485 to 36a-498f, inclusive, 36a-534a, 36a-534b and 36a-671 to 36a-671e, inclusive, may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on any such surety bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed upon the licensee pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50 and any unpaid costs of examination of a licensee as determined pursuant to section 36a-65. The proceeds of any bond, even if commingled with other assets of the principal, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of such claimants against the principal in the event of bankruptcy of the principal and shall be immune from attachment by creditors and judgment creditors. Any bond required by this section shall be maintained during the entire period of the license granted to the applicant, and the aggregate liability under any such bond shall not exceed the penal amount of the bond. The principal shall notify the commissioner of the commencement of an action on the bond. When an action is commenced on a principal’s bond, the commissioner may require the filing of a new bond and immediately on recovery on any action on the bond, the principal shall file a new bond. Any mortgagor or prospective mortgagor who may be damaged by a failure of the debt negotiation licensee or mortgage loan originator licensee to satisfy a judgment against the licensee arising from the negotiation of or offer to negotiate a nonprime home loan, as defined in section 36a-760, may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety on such bond, or both, to recover the amount of the judgment.</p>
			<p>(c) The surety shall have the right to cancel any bond written or issued under subsection (a) of this section at any time by a written notice to the debt negotiation licensee stating the date cancellation shall take effect. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the licensee at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. No such bond shall be cancelled unless the surety notifies the commissioner in writing not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety, the commissioner shall give written notice to the debt negotiation licensee of the date such bond cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the licenses of the debt negotiation licensee on such date and inactivate the license of any sponsored mortgage loan originator, unless prior to such date the debt negotiation licensee submits a letter of reinstatement of the bond from the surety or a new bond, surrenders all licenses or, in the case of a mortgage loan originator sponsored by a debt negotiation licensee, the sponsorship has been terminated and a new sponsor has been requested and approved. After a license has been automatically suspended, the commissioner shall give the debt negotiation licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51 and shall require the debt negotiation licensee to take or refrain from taking such action as, in the opinion of the commissioner, will effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>
			<p>(d) No licensee shall use, attempt to use or make reference to, either directly or indirectly, any word or phrase that states or implies that the licensee is endorsed, sponsored, recommended, bonded or insured by the state.</p>
			<p>(e) The penal sum of the bond required by subdivision (4) of subsection (a) of this section shall be determined as follows:</p>
			<p>(1) An initial applicant for a debt negotiation license shall file a bond in a penal sum of fifty thousand dollars.</p>
			<p>(2) A debt negotiation licensee sponsoring and bonding at least one mortgage loan originator as an exempt registrant under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) and subsection (d) of section 36a-487 shall file a bond with a penal sum in the following amount:</p>
			<p>(A) If the aggregate dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated by all sponsored mortgage loan originators during the preceding twelve-month period ending July thirty-first of the current year is less than thirty million dollars, the penal sum of the bond shall be fifty thousand dollars;</p>
			<p>(B) If the aggregate dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated by all sponsored mortgage loan originators during the preceding twelve-month period ending July thirty-first of the current year is thirty million dollars or more but less than fifty million dollars, the penal sum of the bond shall be one hundred thousand dollars; and</p>
			<p>(C) If the aggregate dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated by all sponsored mortgage loan originators during the preceding twelve-month period ending July thirty-first of the current year is fifty million dollars or more, the penal sum of the bond shall be one hundred fifty thousand dollars.</p>
			<p>(f) For purposes of subsection (e) of this section, “the aggregate dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated” means the aggregate underlying dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans for which a sponsored mortgage loan originator provides debt negotiation services.</p>
			<p>(g) Financial information necessary to verify the aggregate amount of residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated shall be filed with the commissioner as the commissioner may require, and shall be reported on the system, as defined in section 36a-485, at such time and in such form as the system may require. The commissioner may require a change in the penal sum of the bond if the commissioner determines at any time that the aggregate dollar amount of all residential mortgage loans negotiated or offered to be negotiated warrants a change in the penal sum of the bond.</p>
			<p>(h) The commissioner may adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 with respect to the requirements for such surety bonds.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, disclosure statutes are inconsistent if both require disclosure of the same information even though the prescribed definition, method of calculation or manner of expression is different and, in case of such conflict or inconsistency, the provisions of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, shall control, provided sections 36a-746b to 36a-746g, inclusive, shall not be deemed inconsistent with the provisions of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, and shall control where applicable.</p>

In determining the amount of award in any class action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditor’s failure of compliance was intentional. In connection with the disclosures referred to in Section 127 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1637) a creditor shall have a liability determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection only for failing to comply with the requirements of Section 125 or 127(a) of said act (15 USC 1635) or (15 USC 1637(a)) or of paragraph (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) or (10) of Section 127(b) of said act (15 USC 1637(b)). In connection with the disclosures referred to in Section 128 of said act (15 USC 1638) a creditor shall have a liability determined under subdivision (2) of this subsection only for failing to comply with the requirements of Section 125 of said act (15 USC 1635) or of paragraph (2), insofar as it requires a disclosure of the “amount financed”, or paragraph (3), (4), (5), (6) or (9) of Section 128 (a) of said act (15 USC 1638(a)). With respect to any failure to make disclosures required under Chapter 2, 4 or 5 of said act, liability shall be imposed only upon the creditor required to make disclosure, except as provided in Section 131 of said act (15 USC 1641).</p>
			<p>(b) <span class="inline_hd">Adjustment of error.</span> A creditor or assignee has no liability under this section or section 36a-681 or 36a-684 for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, if within sixty days after discovering an error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or notice issued under subsection (d) of section 36a-684, or through the creditor’s or assignee’s own procedures, and prior to the institution of an action under this section or the receipt of written notice of the error from the obligor, the creditor or assignee notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the appropriate account are necessary to insure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge actually disclosed, or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>
			<p>(c) <span class="inline_hd">Bona fide errors.</span> A creditor or assignee may not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, if the creditor or assignee shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Examples of a bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors, except that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person’s obligations under said sections is not a bona fide error.</p>
			<p>(d) <span class="inline_hd">Multiple obligors.</span> When there are multiple obligors in a consumer credit transaction or consumer lease, there shall be no more than one recovery of damages under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section for a violation of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive.</p>
			<p>(e) <span class="inline_hd">Time limit for bringing action.</span> Any action under this section shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation. This subsection does not bar a person from asserting a violation of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, in an action to collect the debt which was brought more than one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation as a matter of defense by recoupment or set-off in such action.</p>
			<p>(f) <span class="inline_hd">Good faith conformance.</span> No provision of this section, subsection (d) of section 36a-684 or section 36a-681 imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any provision of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, or with any rule, regulation, approval or formal interpretation thereof by the commissioner, or in conformity with the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1601 et seq.), including any rule or regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve Board or the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection pursuant to said act, or in conformity with any interpretation of said act by the Federal Reserve Board or the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or in conformity with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Federal Reserve System or the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection duly authorized by the Federal Reserve Board or the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to issue such interpretations or approvals under such procedures as said board or bureau may prescribe therefor, notwithstanding that after such act or omission has occurred, such statute, rule, regulation, approval or interpretation is amended, rescinded or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason.</p>
			<p>(g) <span class="inline_hd">Multiple failure to disclose.</span> The multiple failure to disclose to any person any information required under sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, to be disclosed in connection with a single account under an open-end consumer credit plan, other single consumer credit sale, consumer loan, other extension of consumer credit or consumer lease, shall entitle the person to a single recovery under this section but continued failure to disclose after a recovery has been granted shall give rise to rights to additional recoveries. This subsection does not bar any remedy permitted by subsection (j) of this section.</p>
			<p>(h) <span class="inline_hd">Offsets.</span> A person may not take any action to offset any amount for which a creditor or assignee is potentially liable to such person under subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of this section against any amount owed by such person, unless the amount of the creditor’s or assignee’s liability under sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, has been determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action to which such person was a party. This subsection does not bar a consumer then in default on the obligation from asserting a violation of said sections as an original action, or as a defense or counterclaim to an action to collect amounts owed by the consumer brought by a person liable under said sections.</p>
			<p>(i) <span class="inline_hd">Duplicate recovery prohibited.</span> Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, (1) no person shall be entitled in any action to a recovery under this section for the failure to disclose any information required under said sections if a recovery is awarded in the same action under Section 130 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1640) for the failure to disclose any information required under said sections; and (2) no person shall be entitled in any action brought under this section to a recovery if, prior to an award in any such action, a recovery has been awarded to such person in any action brought under Section 130 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1640) in which the same act or omission was the basis of that action.</p>
			<p>(j) <span class="inline_hd">Rescission.</span> (1) When an obligor exercises his right to rescind under Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within twenty days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, down payment or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. Upon the performance of the creditor’s obligations under this subsection and Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. Tender shall be made at the location of the property or at the residence of the obligor, at the option of the obligor. If the creditor does not take possession of the property within twenty days after tender by the obligor, ownership of the property vests in the obligor without obligation on his part to pay for it. The procedures described by this subdivision shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.</p>
			<p>(2) Notwithstanding any rule of evidence, written acknowledgment of receipt of any disclosures required under sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, by a person to whom information, forms and a statement is required to be given pursuant to this subsection and Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), does no more than create a rebuttable presumption of delivery thereof.</p>
			<p>(3) An obligor’s right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the sale of the property, whichever occurs earlier, notwithstanding the fact that the information and forms required under this section and Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), or any other disclosures required under sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, have not been delivered to the obligor, except that if (A) the commissioner institutes a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this section, or Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), made a part of said sections as provided in section 36a-678, within three years after the date of consummation of the transaction, (B) the commissioner finds a violation of this subsection or Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), and (C) the obligor’s right to rescind is based in whole or in part on any matter involved in such proceeding, then the obligor’s right of rescission shall expire three years after the date of consummation of the transaction or upon the earlier sale of the property, or upon the expiration of one year following the conclusion of the proceeding or any judicial review or period for judicial review thereof, whichever is later.</p>
			<p>(4) (A) In any credit transaction in which an obligor has the right to rescind under Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), and the obligor does not exercise that right, a finance charge may not begin to accrue in connection with such transaction until after midnight of the third business day following the consummation of the transaction. (B) Any obligor required to pay a finance charge, in violation of the provisions of this subdivision, may recover from the creditor twice the amount of such finance charge, costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.</p>
			<p>(5) In any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, in addition to rescission the court may award relief under other subsections of this section for violations of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, not relating to the right to rescind.</p>
			<p>(6) An obligor shall have no rescission rights arising solely from the form of written notice used by the creditor to inform the obligor of the rights of the obligor under this subsection and Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635), if the creditor provided the obligor the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the Federal Reserve Board or the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, or a comparable written notice of the rights of the obligor, that was properly completed by the creditor, and otherwise complied with all other requirements of this subsection and Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635) regarding notice.</p>
			<p>(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (n) of this section, and subject to the time period provided in subdivision (3) of this subsection, an obligor shall have the rescission rights in foreclosure set forth in Subsection (i) of Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635(i)). This subdivision shall apply to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.</p>
			<p>(k) <span class="inline_hd">Action against assignee.</span> (1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, any civil action for a violation of said sections or proceeding by the commissioner which may be brought against a creditor, other than with respect to a consumer credit transaction secured by real property, may be maintained against any assignee of that creditor only if the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement, except where the assignment was involuntary. For the purpose of this subdivision, a violation apparent on the face of the disclosure statement includes, but is not limited to, (A) a disclosure which can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate from the face of the disclosure statement or other documents assigned, or (B) a disclosure not made in the terms required to be used by said sections.</p>
			<p>(2) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of subsection (j) of this section, in any action or proceeding by or against any subsequent assignee of the original creditor without knowledge to the contrary by the assignee when he acquires the obligation, written acknowledgment of receipt by a person to whom a statement is required to be given pursuant to sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, shall be conclusive proof of the delivery thereof and, except as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection, of compliance with Chapter 2 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act. This subsection does not affect the rights of the obligor in any action against the original creditor.</p>
			<p>(3) Any consumer who has the right to rescind a transaction under subsection (j) of this section or Section 125 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1635) may rescind the transaction as against any assignee of the obligation.</p>
			<p>(4) (A) Except as otherwise specifically provided in sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, any civil action against a creditor for a violation of said sections and any proceeding brought by the commissioner against a creditor, with respect to a consumer credit transaction secured by real property, may be maintained against any assignee of such creditor only if (i) the violation for which such action or proceeding was brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement provided in connection with such transaction pursuant to sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, and the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1601 et seq.), and (ii) the assignment to the assignee was voluntary. (B) For purposes of this subdivision, a violation is “apparent on the face of the disclosure statement” if (i) the disclosure can be determined to be incomplete or inaccurate by a comparison among the disclosure statement, any itemization of the amount financed, the note, or any other disclosure of disbursement, or (ii) the disclosure statement does not use the terms or format required to be used by sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, and the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1601 et seq.).</p>
			<p>(5) A servicer of a consumer obligation arising from a consumer credit transaction shall be treated as an assignee of such obligation to the extent provided in Subsection (f) of Section 131 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1641(f)). This subdivision applies to all consumer credit transactions in existence or consummated on or after September 30, 1995.</p>
			<p>(l) <span class="inline_hd">Liability of credit card issuer.</span> (1) Subject to the limitation contained in subdivision (2) of this subsection, a card issuer who has issued a credit card to a cardholder pursuant to an open-end consumer credit plan shall be subject to all claims, other than tort claims, and defenses arising out of any transaction in which the credit card is used as a method of payment or extension of credit if (A) the obligor has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a disagreement or problem relative to the transaction from the person honoring the credit card; (B) the amount of the transaction exceeds fifty dollars; and (C) the transaction took place wholly within this state, provided the mailing address previously provided by the cardholder was within this state and provided the state of billing of the transaction shall not be considered in determining where the transaction took place, or the transaction took place within one hundred miles from the mailing address within this state previously provided by the cardholder, except that the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this subdivision with respect to an obligor’s right to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer shall not be applicable to any transaction in which the person honoring the credit card (i) is the same person as the card issuer, (ii) is controlled by the card issuer, (iii) is under direct or indirect common control with the card issuer, (iv) is a franchised dealer in the card issuer’s products or services, or (v) has obtained the order for such transaction through a mail solicitation made by or participated in by the card issuer in which the cardholder is solicited to enter into such transaction by using the credit card issued by the card issuer.</p>
			<p>(2) The amount of claims or defenses asserted by the cardholder may not exceed the amount of credit outstanding with respect to such transaction at the time the cardholder first notifies the card issuer or the person honoring the credit card of such claim or defense. For the purpose of determining the amount of credit outstanding in this subdivision, payments and credits to the cardholder’s account are deemed to have been applied, in the order indicated, to the payment of: (A) Late charges in the order of their entry to the account; (B) finance charges in order of their entry to the account; and (C) debits to the account other than those set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision, in the order in which each debit entry to the account was made.</p>

			<p>(b) In order to accomplish the purposes of sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, and the provisions of the general statutes referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner may (1) counsel persons and groups on their rights and duties under said sections and provisions, (2) establish programs for the education of consumers with respect to credit and leasing practices and problems and (3) make studies appropriate to effectuate the purposes and policies of said sections and provisions and make the results available to the public.</p>
			<p>(c) The commissioner may by regulation require the maintenance of records related to consumer credit sales, loans and leases sufficient to evidence the adoption of policies calculated to produce compliance with sections 36a-675 to 36a-685, inclusive, and the provisions of the general statutes referred to in subsection (a) of this section which shall be in addition to the record retention requirements imposed under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1601 et seq.).</p>
			<p>(d) (1) In carrying out enforcement activities under this section, the commissioner, in cases where an annual percentage rate or finance charge was inaccurately disclosed, shall notify the creditor of such disclosure error and may require the creditor to make an adjustment to the account of the person to whom credit was extended, to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower. For the purposes of this subsection, except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in determining whether a disclosure error has occurred and in calculating any adjustment, (A) the commissioner shall apply (i) with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance of one-quarter of one per cent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to Section 107(c) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1606(c)), and (ii) with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerance provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate; except that (B) with respect to transactions consummated after March 31, 1982, the commissioner shall apply (i) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of ten years or less, with respect to the annual percentage rate, a tolerance not to exceed one-quarter of one per cent more or less than the actual rate, determined without regard to Section 107(c) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1606(c)), but in no event a tolerance of less than the tolerances allowed under Section 107(c) (15 USC 1606(c)), (ii) for transactions that have a scheduled amortization of more than ten years, with respect to the annual percentage rate, only such tolerances as are allowed under Section 107(c) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1606(c)), and (iii) for all transactions, with respect to the finance charge, a corresponding numerical tolerance as generated by the tolerances provided under this subsection for the annual percentage rate.</p>
			<p>(2) The commissioner shall require such an adjustment when the commissioner determines that such disclosure error resulted from a clear and consistent pattern or practice of violations, from gross negligence, or from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom the credit was extended. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, the commissioner need not require such an adjustment if the commissioner determines that such disclosure error: (A) Resulted from an error involving the disclosure of a fee or charge that would otherwise be excludable in computing the finance charge, including but not limited to, violations involving the disclosures described in Sections 106(b), (c) and (d) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1605(b), (c) and (d)), in which event the commissioner may require such remedial action as the commissioner determines to be equitable, except that for transactions consummated after March 31, 1982, such an adjustment shall be ordered for violations of Section 106(b) (15 USC 1605(b)); (B) involved a disclosed amount which was ten per cent or less of the amount that should have been disclosed and (i) in cases where the error involved a disclosed finance charge, the annual percentage rate was disclosed correctly, and (ii) in cases where the error involved a disclosed annual percentage rate, the finance charge was disclosed correctly; in which event the commissioner may require such adjustment as the commissioner determines to be equitable; (C) involved a total failure to disclose either the annual percentage rate or the finance charge, in which event the commissioner may require such adjustment as the commissioner determines to be equitable; or (D) resulted from any other unique circumstance involving clearly technical and nonsubstantive disclosure violations that do not adversely affect information provided to the consumer and that have not misled or otherwise deceived the consumer. In the case of other such disclosure errors, the commissioner may require such an adjustment.</p>
			<p>(3) Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of this subsection, no adjustment shall be ordered: (A) If it would have a significantly adverse impact upon the safety or soundness of the creditor, but in any such case, the commissioner may require a partial adjustment in an amount which does not have such an impact except that with respect to any transaction consummated after May 18, 1981, the commissioner shall require the full adjustment, but permit the creditor to make the required adjustment in partial payments over an extended period of time which the commissioner considers to be reasonable, (B) if the amount of the adjustment would be less than one dollar, except that if more than one year has elapsed since the date of the violation, the commissioner may require that such amount be paid to the commissioner, (C) except where such disclosure error resulted from a wilful violation which was intended to mislead the person to whom credit was extended, in the case of an open-end credit plan, more than two years after the violation, or in the case of any other extension of credit, as follows: (i) With respect to creditors that have been examined by the commissioner, except in connection with violations arising from practices identified in the current examination and only in connection with transactions that are consummated after the date of the immediately preceding examination, except that where practices giving rise to violations identified in earlier examinations have not been corrected, adjustments for those violations shall be required in connection with transactions consummated after the date of the examination in which such practices were first identified; (ii) with respect to creditors that have not been examined by the commissioner, except in connection with transactions that are consummated after May 10, 1978; and (iii) in no event after the later of (I) the expiration of the life of the credit extension, or (II) two years after the agreement to extend credit was consummated.</p>
			<p>(4) In addition to the enforcement powers authorized by the provisions of this section and section 36a-50, the commissioner may order any creditor to make an adjustment as provided in subdivision (1) of this subsection. After such an order is issued, the persons named therein may, within fourteen days after receipt of the order, file a written request for a hearing. The hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54.</p>
			<p>(5) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner may not require a creditor to make dollar adjustments for errors in any requirements under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1601 et seq.), except with regard to the requirements of Section 165 of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 USC 1666d).</p>
			<p>(6) A creditor shall not be subject to an order to make an adjustment, if within sixty days after discovering a disclosure error, whether pursuant to a final written examination report or through the creditor’s own procedures, the creditor notifies the person concerned of the error and adjusts the account so as to assure that such person will not be required to pay a finance charge in excess of the finance charge actually disclosed or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate actually disclosed, whichever is lower.</p>

			<p>If you have reviewed your credit report with the credit rating agency and are dissatisfied, you may contact the Connecticut Department of Banking. You have a right to bring civil action against anyone who knowingly or wilfully misuses file data or improperly obtains access to your file.”</p>

Such consumer shall submit such request, in writing, to the credit rating agency, together with proof of such consumer’s identity and a copy of a police report prepared pursuant to section 54-1n. Not later than thirty days after receipt of such request, the credit rating agency shall block reporting any information that the consumer alleges appears on his or her credit report as a result of such violation so that the information cannot be reported. The credit rating agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of the information that a police report has been filed, that a block has been requested and the effective date of the block.</p>
			<p>(b) A credit rating agency may decline to block or may rescind any block of consumer information if the credit rating agency believes in good faith that: (1) The information was blocked due to a misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block under this section, (2) the consumer agrees that the blocked information or portions of the blocked information were blocked in error, (3) the consumer knowingly obtained possession of goods, services or moneys as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions or the consumer should have known that he or she obtained possession of goods, services or moneys as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions, (4) the information was blocked due to fraud in which the consumer participated or of which the consumer had knowledge, and which may for purposes of this section be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence, or (5) the credit rating agency, in the exercise of good faith and reasonable judgment, has substantial reason based on specific, verifiable facts to doubt the authenticity of the consumer’s report of a violation of section 53a-129a of the general statutes, revision of 1958, revised to January 1, 2003, or section 53a-129b, 53a-129c or 53a-129d.</p>

In the event any such credit rating agency refuses to implement or removes a security freeze pursuant to this subsection, such credit rating agency shall promptly notify such consumer in writing of such refusal not later than five business days after such refusal or, in the case of a removal of a security freeze, prior to removing the freeze on the consumer’s credit report.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, “reviewing the account” includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases and account upgrades and enhancements.</p>
			<p>(h) The following persons shall not be required to place a security freeze on a consumer’s credit report, provided such persons shall be subject to any security freeze placed on a credit report by another credit rating agency: (1) A check services or fraud prevention services company that reports on incidents of fraud or issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers or similar methods of payment; (2) a deposit account information service company that issues reports regarding account closures due to fraud, substantial overdrafts, automated teller machine abuse, or similar information regarding a consumer to inquiring banks or other financial institutions for use only in reviewing a consumer request for a deposit account at the inquiring bank or financial institution; or (3) a credit rating agency that: (A) Acts only to resell credit information by assembling and merging information contained in a database of one or more credit reporting agencies; and (B) does not maintain a permanent database of credit information from which new credit reports are produced.</p>
			<p>(i) A credit rating agency may charge a fee of not more than ten dollars to a consumer for each security freeze, removal of such freeze or temporary lift of such freeze for a period of time, and a fee of not more than twelve dollars for a temporary lift of such freeze for a specific party.</p>
			<p>(j) An insurer, as defined in section 38a-1, may deny an application for insurance if an applicant has placed a security freeze on such applicant’s credit report and fails to authorize the disclosure of such applicant’s credit report to such insurer pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

(2) In the event a mortgage rate lock-in is issued after the mortgage loan application is submitted to the lender, the minimum period for which the terms may be locked in shall be the period determined in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection, less the number of days elapsed since the application was submitted to the lender.</p>

In such cases the applicant shall be entitled to a refund of all funds paid by the applicant which have not actually been expended by the mortgage lender.</p>

If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license, and shall notify the applicant of the denial and the reasons for such denial. For purposes of this subsection, the level of offense of the crime and the status of any conviction, pardon or expungement shall be determined by reference to the law of the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted. In the event such jurisdiction does not use the term “felony”, “pardon” or “expungement”, such terms shall include legally equivalent events. For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, “experience in the mortgage servicing business” means paid experience in the (A) servicing of mortgage loans, (B) accounting, receipt and processing of payments on behalf of mortgagees or creditors, or (C) supervision of such activities, or any other relevant experience as determined by the commissioner.</p>

			<p>(c) (1) The minimum standards for license renewal for a mortgage servicer shall include the following: (A) The applicant continues to meet the minimum standards under subsection (a) of this section; and (B) the mortgage servicer has paid all required fees for renewal of the license.</p>
			<p>(2) The license of a mortgage servicer failing to satisfy the minimum standards for license renewal shall expire.

The commissioner may automatically suspend a mortgage servicer license if the licensee receives a deficiency on the system indicating that the payment required by section 36a-719b was Returned-ACH or returned pursuant to such other term as may be utilized by the system to indicate that the payment was not accepted. After a license has been automatically suspended pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall give such licensee notice of the automatic suspension, pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew pursuant to section 36a-719j and an opportunity for a hearing on such action in accordance with section 36a-51 and require such licensee to take or refrain from taking such action that, in the opinion of the commissioner, will effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>
			<p>(d) (1) Withdrawal of an application for a license filed under this section shall become effective upon receipt by the commissioner of a notice of intent to withdraw such application. The commissioner may deny a license up to one year after the effective date of withdrawal.</p>
			<p>(2) If the license of a mortgage servicer expires due to the licensee’s failure to renew, the commissioner may institute a revocation or suspension proceeding or issue an order suspending or revoking such license pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-719j not later than one year after the date of such expiration.</p>
			<p>(e) The commissioner may deem an application for a license under this section abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-715 to 36a-719<i>l</i>, inclusive, or the regulations adopted pursuant to said sections. The commissioner shall notify the applicant on the system that if such information is not submitted not later than sixty days from the date of such request, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded.

			<p>(b) The surety bond required by subsection (a) of this section shall be (1) in a form approved by the Attorney General; and (2) conditioned upon the mortgage servicer licensee or person exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 faithfully performing any and all written agreements or commitments with or for the benefit of mortgagors and mortgagees, truly and faithfully accounting for all funds received from a mortgagor or mortgagee in such person’s capacity as a mortgage servicer, and conducting such mortgage business consistent with the provisions of sections 36a-715 to 36a-719<i>l</i>, inclusive. Any mortgagor that may be damaged by the failure of a mortgage servicer licensee or person exempt from mortgage servicer licensure pursuant to subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of section 36a-718 to perform any written agreements or commitments, or by the wrongful conversion of funds paid by a mortgagor to such licensee or person, may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety thereon, or both, to recover damages. The commissioner may proceed on such bond against the principal or surety on such bond, or both, to collect any civil penalty imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 36a-50, any restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (c) of section 36a-50 and any unpaid costs of examination of a licensee as determined pursuant to section 36a-65. The proceeds of the bond, even if commingled with other assets of the principal, shall be deemed by operation of law to be held in trust for the benefit of such claimants against the principal in the event of bankruptcy of the principal and shall be immune from attachment by creditors and judgment creditors. The surety bond shall run concurrently with the period of the license for the main office of the mortgage servicer or mortgage lender and the aggregate liability under the bond shall not exceed the penal sum of the bond. The principal shall notify the commissioner of the commencement of an action on the bond. When an action is commenced on a principal’s bond, the commissioner may require the filing of a new bond and immediately on recovery on any action on the bond, the principal shall file a new bond.</p>

The fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage shall each be in the following principal amounts based on the mortgage servicer’s volume of servicing activity most recently reported to the commissioner:</p>
			<p>(1) If the amount of the residential mortgage loans serviced is one hundred million dollars or less, the principal amount shall be three hundred thousand dollars; or</p>

Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the principal at least thirty days prior to the date of cancellation. A surety bond, fidelity bond or errors and omissions coverage shall not be cancelled unless the surety notifies the commissioner, in writing, not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of cancellation. After receipt of such notification from the surety, the commissioner shall give written notice to the principal of the date such cancellation shall take effect. The commissioner shall automatically suspend the license of a mortgage servicer on such date. No automatic suspension or inactivation shall occur if, prior to the date that such bond or errors and omissions coverage cancellation shall take effect, (1) the principal submits a letter of reinstatement of the bond or errors and omissions coverage, or a new bond or errors and omissions policy; or (2) the mortgage servicer licensee has ceased business in this state and has surrendered all licenses in accordance with section 36a-51 and section 36a-719a.

The licensee shall file any such additional bonds not later than ten days after receipt of the commissioner’s written notice of such requirement. A mortgage servicer or mortgage lender licensee shall file, as the commissioner may require, any bond rider or endorsement or addendum, as applicable, to any bond or evidence of errors and omissions coverage on file with the commissioner to reflect any changes necessary to maintain the surety bond, fidelity bond and errors and omissions coverage required by this section.</p>

			<p>(1) Pay a contractor under a home improvement contract from the proceeds of the loan, other than:</p>
			<p>(A) By an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor; or</p>
			<p>(B) At the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender and the contractor prior to the disbursement;</p>
			<p>(2) Sell or otherwise assign such loan without furnishing the following statement to the purchaser or assignee: “Notice: This is a loan subject to special rules under the Connecticut Abusive Home Loan Lending Practices Act. Purchasers or assignees of this loan could be liable for all claims and defenses with respect to the loan that the borrower could assert against the lender”;</p>
			<p>(3) Charge, impose or cause to be paid, directly or indirectly, prepaid finance charges that exceed in the aggregate, the greater of five per cent of the principal amount of the loan or two thousand dollars. If the proceeds of a high cost home loan are used to refinance an existing loan, the aggregate of the prepaid finance charges for the current refinancing and any previous high cost home loan financings or financings subject to the provisions of section 36a-498a, by the same lender or affiliate of the same lender within two years of the current refinancing shall not exceed the greater of five per cent of the principal amount of the initial loan, or two thousand dollars. The provisions of this subdivision do not prohibit a lender from charging, imposing or causing to be paid, directly or indirectly, prepaid finance charges in addition to those permitted by this subdivision in connection with any additional proceeds received by the borrower in the refinancing, provided such prepaid finance charges on the additional proceeds shall not exceed five per cent of the additional proceeds. For purposes of this subdivision, “additional proceeds” means: (A) For a closed-end loan, the amount by which the new loan exceeds the current principal balance of the existing loan, and (B) for an open-end loan, the amount by which the line of credit on the new loan exceeds the maximum credit limit of the existing loan;</p>
			<p>(4) Charge a borrower any fees to modify, renew, extend or amend a high cost home loan or defer any payment due under a high cost home loan, if after the modification, renewal, extension or amendment, the loan is still a high cost home loan, or if no longer a high cost home loan, the APR has not been reduced by at least two percentage points. For purposes of this subdivision, “fees” does not include interest that is otherwise payable and consistent with the provisions of the loan documents. The provisions of this subdivision do not prohibit a lender from charging, imposing or causing to be paid, directly or indirectly, prepaid finance charges in connection with any additional proceeds, as defined in subdivision (3) of this section, received by the borrower in connection with the modification, renewal, extension or amendment, provided the prepaid finance charges on the additional proceeds do not exceed five per cent of the additional proceeds. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply if the existing high cost home loan is sixty or more days delinquent and the modification, renewal, extension, amendment or deferral is part of a work-out process;</p>
			<p>(5) Make such loan unless the lender reasonably believes at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the loan based upon a consideration of the borrower’s current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, excluding the borrower’s equity in the dwelling that secures repayment of the loan. The borrower shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the loan if at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate adjustment in the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the borrower’s monthly debts, including amounts owed under the mortgage, do not exceed fifty per cent of the borrower’s monthly gross income, as verified by the borrower’s signed financial statement, a credit report, and payment records for employment income;</p>
			<p>(6) Advertise that refinancing preexisting debt with a high cost home loan will reduce a borrower’s aggregate monthly debt payment without also disclosing that the high cost home loan may increase both the borrower’s aggregate number of monthly debt payments and the aggregate amount paid by the borrower over the term of the high cost home loan;</p>
			<p>(7) Recommend or encourage default or further default by a borrower on an existing loan or other debt, prior to the closing of a high cost home loan that refinances all or any portion of such existing loan or debt;</p>
			<p>(8) Make such loan to a borrower that refinances an existing loan unless the high cost home loan provides a benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances, including the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan, and the borrower’s circumstances;</p>
			<p>(9) Make such loan with an interest rate that is unconscionable. A lender shall base the interest rate for a high cost home loan on proper and reasonable factors including, but not limited to, creditworthiness, other risk related standards and sound underwriting. For purposes of this subdivision, an interest rate that is not based on such factors, or that significantly deviates from industry standards for making that type of high cost home loan, shall be deemed unconscionable; and</p>

			<p>(6) “Mortgage broker” means any person, other than a lender, who (A) for a fee, commission or other valuable consideration, negotiates, solicits, arranges, places or finds a mortgage, and (B) who is required to be licensed by the Department of Banking under chapter 668, or such person’s successors or assigns;</p>
			<p>(7) “Nonprime home loan” means any loan or extension of credit, excluding an open-end line of credit, any mortgage insured under Title II of the National Housing Act, 12 USC 1701 et seq. that satisfies the requirements for a qualified mortgage set forth in 78 Federal Register 75215 (December 11, 2013), and a reverse mortgage transaction, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.33, as amended from time to time:</p>
			<p>(A) In which the borrower is a natural person;</p>
			<p>(B) The proceeds of which are to be used primarily for personal family or household purposes;</p>
			<p>(C) In which the loan is secured by a mortgage upon any interest in one-to-four family residential real property located in this state which is, or when the loan is made, intended to be used or occupied by the borrower as a principal residence;</p>
			<p>(D) In which the principal amount of the loan does not exceed four hundred seventeen thousand dollars;</p>
			<p>(E) Where the loan is not a CHFA loan; and</p>
			<p>(F) In which the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph apply, subject to any adjustments made pursuant to clause (iii) of this subparagraph:</p>

For purposes of this clause, the relevant factors to be considered by the commissioner shall include, but not be limited to, the existence and amount of increases in fees or charges in connection with purchases of mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and increases in fees or charges imposed by mortgage insurers and the impact, including the magnitude of the impact, that such increases have had, or will likely have, on APRs for mortgage loans in this state. When considering such factors, the commissioner shall focus on those increases that are related to the deterioration in the housing market and credit conditions. The commissioner may refrain from increasing such percentages if it appears that lenders are increasing interest rates or fees in bad faith or if increasing the percentages would be contrary to the purposes of sections 36a-760 to 36a-760f, inclusive. No increase authorized by the commissioner to a particular percentage shall exceed one-quarter of one percentage point, and the total of all increases to a particular percentage under this clause shall not exceed one-half of one percentage point. No increase shall be made unless: (I) The increase is noticed in the Banking Department Bulletin and the Connecticut Law Journal, and (II) a public comment period of twenty days is provided. Any increase made under this clause shall be reduced proportionately when the need for the increase has diminished or no longer exists.

			<p>(9) “Secondary mortgage loan” has the same meaning as provided in section 36a-485.</p>
			<p>(b) The provisions of sections 36a-760a to 36a-760i, inclusive, shall be applicable to nonprime home loans and mortgages, as appropriate, for which applications have been received on or after August 1, 2008.</p>

Analysis of obligor’s ability to pay.</span> (a) No lender shall make a nonprime home loan unless the lender reasonably believes, at the time the loan is consummated, that one or more of the obligors, when considered individually or collectively, will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the loan, and to pay related real estate taxes and insurance premiums, based upon a consideration of the obligor’s current and expected income, current and expected obligations as disclosed by the obligor, or otherwise known to the lender, including subordinate mortgages made contemporaneously, homeowner’s fees, condominium fees, employment status and other financial resources, excluding the equity in the dwelling that secures repayment of the loan. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, in the case of a bridge loan, a lender may consider the equity in the dwelling as a source of repayment for the loan.</p>
			<p>(b) A lender’s analysis of an obligor’s ability to repay under subsection (a) of this section may utilize commercially recognized underwriting standards and methodologies, including automated underwriting systems, provided they comply with the requirements of this subsection and subsection (a) of this section. In determining an obligor’s ability to repay a nonprime home loan, the lender shall take reasonable steps to verify the accuracy and completeness of information provided by or on behalf of the obligor using tax returns, consumer reports, payroll receipts, bank records, reasonable alternative methods or reasonable third-party verification. In determining an obligor’s ability to repay a nonprime home loan according to its terms when the loan has an adjustable rate feature, the lender shall underwrite the repayment schedule assuming that the interest rate is a fixed rate equal to the fully indexed interest rate at the time of consummation, or within fifteen days thereof, without considering any initial discounted rate. For purposes of this subsection, the “fully indexed rate” means the interest rate that would have been applied had the initial interest rate been determined by the application of the same interest rate formula that applies under the terms of the loan documents to subsequent interest rate adjustments, disregarding any limitations on the amount by which the interest rate may change at any one time. In determining an obligor’s ability to repay a nonprime home loan that is not fully amortizing by its terms, the lender shall underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing repayment schedule based on the maturity set forth in the note.</p>

			<p>(b) A lender shall not make and a mortgage broker shall not offer a nonprime home loan that refinances a mortgage unless the nonprime home loan provides or is expected to provide a tangible net benefit to the borrower. A lender or mortgage broker shall not take any action that recommends or encourages a default on an existing mortgage or other debt prior to and in connection with the closing or planned closing of a new nonprime home loan that refinances all or any portion of the existing loan or debt.</p>
			<p>(c) A lender may not finance, directly or indirectly in connection with a mortgage, any credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment or credit property insurance, or any other life or health insurance or any payments directly or indirectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or contract, except that insurance premiums or debt cancellation or suspension fees calculated and paid on a monthly basis or through regularly scheduled periodic payments shall not be considered financed by the lender for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
			<p>(d) If all defaults in connection with a nonprime home loan are cured after the initiation of any action to foreclose, but prior to the entry of judgment, the lender shall take steps as necessary to terminate the foreclosure proceeding or other action. The lender may require that the borrower pay any reasonable costs actually incurred by the lender in connection with the default and protecting its rights in the property, including any costs related to collection, foreclosure and termination of the proceeding or other action. Cure of default reinstates the borrower to the same position as if the default had not occurred and nullifies, as of the date of the cure, any acceleration of any obligation under the security instrument or note arising from the default. The borrower’s right to reinstatement, as described in this subsection, may not be exercised by the borrower on more than two occasions over the course of twenty-four consecutive months.</p>

			<p><span class="catchln" id="sec_36a-785">Sec. 36a-785. (Formerly Sec. 42-98). Foreclosure.</span> (a) <span class="inline_hd">Repossession.</span> When the retail buyer is in default in the payment of any sum due under the retail installment contract or installment loan contract, or in the performance of any other condition that such contract requires him to perform, or in the performance of any promise, the breach of which is by such contract expressly made a ground for the retaking of the goods, the holder of the contract may retake possession thereof, provided the filing of a petition in bankruptcy under 11 USC Chapter 7 by a retail buyer of a motor vehicle, or such retail buyer’s status as a debtor in bankruptcy, shall not be considered a default of a retail installment contract or ground for repossession of such motor vehicle. Unless the goods can be retaken without breach of the peace, it shall be retaken by legal process, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize a violation of the criminal law. In the case of repossession of any motor vehicle without the knowledge of the retail buyer, the local police department shall be notified of such repossession immediately thereafter. In the absence of a local police department or if the local police department cannot be reached for notification, the state police shall be promptly notified of such repossession.</p>
			<p>(b) <span class="inline_hd">Notice of intention to repossess.</span> Not less than ten days prior to the retaking, the holder of such contract, if he so desires, may serve upon the retail buyer, personally or by registered or certified mail, a notice of intention to retake the goods on account of the buyer’s default. The notice shall state the default and the period at the end of which such goods will be retaken, and shall briefly and clearly state what the retail buyer’s rights under this subsection will be in case such goods are retaken. If the notice is so served and the buyer does not perform the conditions and provisions as to which he is in default before the day set for retaking, the holder of the contract may retake said goods and hold such subject to the provisions of subsections (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of this section regarding resale, but without any right of redemption.</p>
			<p>(c) <span class="inline_hd">Redemption.</span> If the holder of such contract does not give the notice of intention to retake, described in subsection (b), he shall retain such goods for fifteen days after the retaking within the state in which they were located when retaken. During such period the retail buyer, upon payment or tender of the unaccelerated amount due under such contract at the time of retaking and interest, or upon performance or tender of performance of such other condition as may be named in such contract as precedent to the retail buyer’s continued possession of such goods, or upon performance or tender of performance of any other promise for the breach of which such goods were retaken, and upon payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing, may redeem such goods and become entitled to take possession of the same and to continue in the performance of such contract as if no default had occurred. The holder of such contract shall within three days of the retaking furnish or mail, by registered or certified mail, to the last known address of the buyer a written statement of the unaccelerated sum due under such contract and the actual and reasonable expense of any retaking and storing. For failure to furnish or mail such statement as required by this section, the holder of the contract shall forfeit the right to claim payment for the actual and reasonable expenses of retaking and storage, and also shall be liable for the actual damages suffered because of such failure. If such goods are perishable so that retention for fifteen days as herein prescribed would result in their destruction or substantial injury, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply and the holder of the contract may resell the goods immediately upon such retaking.</p>
			<p>(d) <span class="inline_hd">Compulsory resale.</span> If the retail buyer does not redeem such goods within fifteen days after the holder of the contract has retaken possession, the holder of the contract shall sell such goods at public or private sale which sale may be held not less than fifteen days and shall be held not more than one hundred eighty days after the retaking. When the holder of the contract retakes possession by legal process, and an answer is interposed, the holder of the contract may, at his election, hold such retaken goods for a period not to exceed thirty days after the entry of final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction entitling the holder of the contract to possession of such goods before holding such resale. The holder of the contract shall give the retail buyer not less than ten days’ written notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, either personally or by registered mail or by certified mail receipted for on mailing directed to the retail buyer at his last-known place of business or residence. The holder of the contract may bid for such goods at any public sale. The proceeds of the resale shall be considered to be either the amount paid for such goods at such sale or the fair cash retail market value of such goods at the time of repossession, whichever is the greater, except as otherwise provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
			<p>(e) <span class="inline_hd">Proceeds of resale.</span> Proceeds of the resale shall be applied (1) to the payment of the actual and reasonable expenses thereof, (2) to the payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing of said goods, (3) to the satisfaction of the balance due under the contract. Within thirty days of the resale, the holder of the contract shall give the retail buyer a written statement itemizing the disposition of the proceeds. Any sum remaining after the satisfaction of such claims shall be paid to the retail buyer.</p>
			<p>(f) <span class="inline_hd">Deficiency on resale.</span> Notwithstanding that the proceeds of the resale are not sufficient to defray the actual and reasonable expenses thereof, and also such actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing of such goods and the balance due under the contract, the holder of the contract may not recover the deficiency from the retail buyer or any surety or guarantor for him, or from any one who has succeeded to the obligations of such retail buyer, except as provided in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
			<p>(g) <span class="inline_hd">Fair market value.</span> If the goods retaken consist of a motor vehicle the aggregate cash price of which was more than two thousand dollars, the prima facie fair market value of such motor vehicle shall be calculated by adding together the average trade-in value for that motor vehicle and the average retail value for that motor vehicle and dividing that sum by two. Such average trade-in value and average retail value shall be determined by the values as stated in the National Automobile Dealers Association Used Car Guide, Eastern Edition, as of the date of repossession. If the goods retaken consist of a boat the aggregate cash price of which was more than two thousand dollars, the prima facie fair market value of such boat shall be calculated by adding together the average trade-in value for that boat and the average retail value for that boat and dividing that sum by two. Such average trade-in value and average retail value shall be determined by the values as stated in the National Automobile Dealers Association Appraisal Guide for Boats, Eastern Edition, as of the date of repossession. In the event that the value of such motor vehicle or boat is not stated in such publication, then the fair market value at retail minus the reasonable costs of resale shall be determined by the court. The prima facie evidence of fair market value of such motor vehicle or boat so determined may be rebutted only by direct in-court testimony. If such value of the motor vehicle or boat is less than the balance due under the contract, plus the actual and reasonable expenses of the retaking of possession, the holder of the contract may recover from the retail buyer, or from anyone who has succeeded to his obligations, as a deficiency, the amount by which such liability exceeds such fair market value, as defined in this subsection. If the actual resale price received by the holder exceeds such fair market value, as defined in this subsection, the actual resale price shall govern.</p>
			<p>(h) <span class="inline_hd">Election of remedies.</span> After the holder retakes possession as provided in subsection (a), or if the holder obtains a prejudgment remedy against the goods under chapter 903a, the retail buyer or anyone who has succeeded to his obligations shall not be liable for any balance due, except to the extent permitted by subsection (g) of this section. The holder may seek a monetary judgment on the contract against the buyer unless the goods have been repossessed, with or without judicial process. Goods purchased under the contract shall not be executed upon to satisfy such judgment. When such judgment becomes final, the holder’s security interest in the goods shall be extinguished. If the contract covers a retail sale of a motor vehicle required to be registered, the holder shall comply with section 14-188.</p>
			<p>(i) <span class="inline_hd">Recovery of part payments.</span> If the holder of the contract fails to comply with the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h), after retaking the goods, the retail buyer may recover from the holder of the contract his actual damages, if any, and in no event less than one-fourth of the sum of all payments which have been made under the contract.</p>
			<p>(j) <span class="inline_hd">Waiver of statutory protection.</span> No act or agreement of the retail buyer before or at the time of the making of a retail installment contract or installment loan contract nor any agreement or statement by the retail buyer in such contract shall constitute a valid waiver of the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i).</p>
			<p>(k) <span class="inline_hd">Loss.</span> After the delivery of the goods to the retail buyer and prior to any retaking thereof by the holder of the contract, the risk of injury and loss shall rest upon the retail buyer.</p>

It includes persons who furnish collection systems carrying a name which simulates the name of a consumer collection agency and who supply forms or form letters to be used by the creditor, even though such forms direct the consumer debtor or property tax debtor to make payments directly to the creditor rather than to such fictitious agency. “Consumer collection agency” further includes any person who, in attempting to collect or in collecting such person’s own accounts or claims from a consumer debtor, uses a fictitious name or any name other than such person’s own name which would indicate to the consumer debtor that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such account or claim. “Consumer collection agency” does not include (i) an individual employed on the staff of a licensed consumer collection agency, or by a creditor who is exempt from licensing, when attempting to collect on behalf of such consumer collection agency, (ii) persons not primarily engaged in the collection of debts from consumer debtors who receive funds in escrow for subsequent distribution to others, including, but not limited to, real estate brokers and lenders holding funds of borrowers for payment of taxes or insurance, (iii) any public officer or a person acting under the order of any court, (iv) any member of the bar of this state, (v) a person who services loans or accounts for the owners thereof when the arrangement includes, in addition to requesting payment from delinquent consumer debtors, the providing of other services such as receipt of payment, accounting, record-keeping, data processing services and remitting, for loans or accounts which are current as well as those which are delinquent, (vi) a bank or out-of-state bank, as defined in section 36a-2, and (vii) a subsidiary or affiliate of a bank or out-of-state bank, provided such affiliate or subsidiary is not primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and collecting upon delinquent debt, other than delinquent debt secured by real property.

Examination of records. Abandonment of application. Automatic suspension of license. Name and place of business.</span> (a) No person shall act within this state as a consumer collection agency unless such person has first obtained a consumer collection agency license for such person’s main office and each branch office where such person’s business is conducted. A consumer collection agency is acting within this state if it (1) has its place of business located within this state; (2) has its place of business located outside this state and (A) collects from consumer debtors or property tax debtors who reside within this state for creditors who are located within this state, or (B) collects from consumer debtors or property tax debtors who reside within this state for such consumer collection agency’s own account; (3) has its place of business located outside this state and regularly collects from consumer debtors or property tax debtors who reside within this state for creditors who are located outside this state; or (4) has its place of business located outside this state and is engaged in the business of collecting child support for creditors located within this state from consumer debtors who are located outside this state.</p>
			<p>(b) Any person desiring to act within this state as a consumer collection agency shall make a written application to the commissioner for such license in such form as the commissioner prescribes. Such application shall be accompanied by (1) a financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant or a public accountant, the accuracy of which is sworn to under oath before a notary public by the proprietor, a general partner or a corporate officer or a member duly authorized to execute such documents, (2) (A) the history of criminal convictions of the (i) applicant; (ii) partners, if the applicant is a partnership; (iii) members, if the applicant is a limited liability company or association; or (iv) officers, directors and principal employees, if the applicant is a corporation, and (B) sufficient information pertaining to the history of criminal convictions of such applicant, partners, members, officers, directors and principal employees as the commissioner deems necessary to make the findings under subsection (c) of this section, (3) a license fee of eight hundred dollars, or in the case of an initial application that is filed not earlier than one year before the date such license will expire, a license fee of four hundred dollars, and (4) an investigation fee of one hundred dollars. The commissioner shall cause to be made such inquiry and examination as to the qualifications of each such applicant or any partner, member, officer, director or principal employee of the applicant as the commissioner deems necessary. The commissioner, in accordance with section 29-17a, may conduct a state and national criminal history records check of the applicant and of each partner, member, officer, director and principal employee of such applicant. Each applicant shall furnish satisfactory evidence to the commissioner that the applicant is a person of good moral character and is financially responsible.</p>
			<p>(c) If the commissioner finds, upon the filing of an application for a consumer collection agency, that (1) the financial responsibility, character, reputation, integrity and general fitness of the applicant and the partners of such applicant if the applicant is a partnership, of the members if the applicant is a limited liability company or association, and of the officers, directors and principal employees if the applicant is a corporation, are such to warrant belief that the business will be operated soundly and efficiently, in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of sections 36a-800 to 36a-810, inclusive, and (2) the applicant is solvent and no proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership or assignment for the benefit of creditors has been commenced against the applicant, the commissioner may, upon such finding, issue the applicant a consumer collection agency license. If the commissioner fails to make such findings, the commissioner shall not issue a license and shall notify the applicant of the reasons for such denial. The commissioner may deny an application if the commissioner finds that the applicant or any partner, member, officer, director or principal employee of such applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor involving any aspect of the consumer collection agency business, or any felony. Any denial of an application by the commissioner shall, when applicable, be subject to the provisions of section 46a-80. Any such license issued by the commissioner shall expire at the close of business on September thirtieth of the odd-numbered year following its issuance, unless such license is renewed. The commissioner may renew such application, in the commissioner’s discretion, upon filing of a proper renewal application accompanied by a license fee of eight hundred dollars, and satisfactory proof that such applicant at that time possesses the required qualifications for the license. The commissioner may deny a renewal application if the commissioner finds that the applicant has been convicted of any misdemeanor involving any aspect of the consumer collection agency business, or any felony. Any denial of an application by the commissioner shall, when applicable, be subject to the provisions of section 46a-80. Such renewal application shall be filed with the commissioner on or before September first of the year in which the license expires. Any renewal application filed with the commissioner after September first shall be accompanied by a one-hundred-dollar late fee and any such filing shall be deemed to be timely and sufficient for purposes of subsection (b) of section 4-182. Whenever an application for a license, other than a renewal application, is filed under sections 36a-800 to 36a-810, inclusive, by any person who was a licensee under said sections 36a-800 to 36a-810, inclusive, and whose license expired less than sixty days prior to the date such application was filed, such application shall be accompanied by a one-hundred-dollar processing fee in addition to the application fee.</p>
			<p>(d) To further the enforcement of this section and to determine the eligibility of any person holding a license, the commissioner may, as often as the commissioner deems necessary, examine the licensee’s books and records, and may, at any time, require the licensee to submit such a financial statement for the examination of the commissioner, so that the commissioner may determine whether the licensee is financially responsible to carry on a consumer collection agency business within the intents and purposes of sections 36a-800 to 36a-810, inclusive. Any financial statement submitted by a licensee shall be confidential and shall not be a public record unless introduced in evidence at a hearing conducted by the commissioner.</p>
			<p>(e) The applicant or licensee shall notify the commissioner, in writing, of any change in the information provided in its initial application for a license or most recent renewal application for such license, as applicable, not later than ten business days after the occurrence of the event that results in such information becoming inaccurate.</p>
			<p>(f) The commissioner may deem an application for a license to act as a consumer collection agency abandoned if the applicant fails to respond to any request for information required under sections 36a-801 to 36a-810, inclusive, or any regulations adopted pursuant to said sections 36a-801 to 36a-810, inclusive. The commissioner shall notify the applicant, in writing, that if the applicant fails to submit such information not later than sixty days after the date on which such request for information was made, the application shall be deemed abandoned. An application filing fee paid prior to the date an application is deemed abandoned pursuant to this subsection shall not be refunded. Abandonment of an application pursuant to this subsection shall not preclude the applicant from submitting a new application for a license under sections 36a-801 to 36a-810, inclusive.</p>
			<p>(g) If the commissioner determines that a check filed with the commissioner to pay a fee under subsection (b) of this section has been dishonored, the commissioner shall automatically suspend the license or a renewal license that has been issued but is not yet effective. The commissioner shall give the licensee notice of the automatic suspension pending proceedings for revocation or refusal to renew and an opportunity for a hearing on such actions in accordance with section 36a-51.</p>
			<p>(h) No abatement of the license fee shall be made if the license is surrendered, revoked or suspended prior to the expiration of the period for which it was issued. All fees required by this section shall be nonrefundable.</p>
			<p>(i) No person licensed to act within this state as a consumer collection agency shall do so under any other name or at any other place of business than that named in the license. Any change of location of a place of business of a licensee shall require prior written notice to the commissioner. Not more than one place of business shall be maintained under the same license but the commissioner may issue more than one license to the same licensee upon compliance with the provisions of sections 36a-800 to 36a-810, inclusive, as to each new licensee. A license shall not be transferable or assignable. Any licensee holding, applying for, or seeking renewal of more than one license may, at its option, file the bond required under section 36a-802 separately for each place of business licensed, or to be licensed, or a single bond, naming each place of business, in an amount equal to twenty-five thousand dollars for each place of business.</p>
