The notice shall indicate that the entity knows of the unauthorized acquisition of personal infor- mation pertaining to the subject of the personal information.

(br) If, as the result of a single incident, an entity is required under par.

(cm) Notwithstanding pars. (a), (b), (bm), and (br), an entity is not required to provide notice of the acquisition of personal information if any of the following applies:
1. The acquisition of personal information does not create a material risk of identity theft or fraud to the subject of the personal information.

(3) TIMING AND MANNER OF NOTICE; OTHER REQUIREMENTS. (a) Subject to sub. (5), an entity shall provide the notice required under sub.

(b) An entity shall provide the notice required under sub. (2) by mail or by a method the entity has previously employed to com- municate with the subject of the personal information. If an entity cannot with reasonable diligence determine the mailing address of the subject of the personal information, and if the entity has not previously communicated with the subject of the personal infor- mation, the entity shall provide notice by a method reasonably cal- culated to provide actual notice to the subject of the personal infor- mation.

(5) REQUEST BY LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT TO NOTIFY. A law enforcement agency may, in order to protect an investigation or homeland security, ask an entity not to provide a notice that is oth- erwise required under sub. (2) for any period of time and the notifi- cation process required under sub. (2) shall begin at the end of that time period. Notwithstanding subs.
