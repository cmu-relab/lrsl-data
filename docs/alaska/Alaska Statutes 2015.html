You have a right <br>to place a security freeze on your credit report and credit score under<br>state law (<a onclick="checkLink(&#39;45.48.100&#39;)" href="http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/statutes.asp#45.48.100">AS 45.48.100</a> - 45.48.290).                                  <br>    The security freeze will prohibit a consumer credit reporting<br> agency from releasing your credit score and any information in your   <br>credit report without your express authorization or approval.          <br>    The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and other<br>services from being approved in your name without your consent.<br> However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take     <br>control over who gets access to the personal and financial information <br>in your credit report and credit score may delay, interfere with, or   <br>prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application  <br>you make regarding a new loan, credit, a mortgage, a governmental      <br>service, a governmental payment, a cellular telephone, a utility, an   <br>Internet credit card application, an extension of credit at point of   <br>sale, and other items and services.                                    <br>    When you place a security freeze on your credit report and credit  <br>score, within 10 business days, you will be provided a personal        <br>identification number, password, or similar device to use if you choose<br>to remove the freeze on your credit report and credit score or to      <br>temporarily authorize the release of your credit report and credit<br> score to a specific third party or specific third parties or for a    <br>specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that  <br>authorization, you must contact the consumer credit reporting agency<br> and provide all of the following:                                     <br>     (1) proper identification to verify your identity;                <br>     (2) the personal identification number, password, or similar<br> device provided by the consumer credit reporting agency;              <br>     (3) proper information necessary to identify the third party or   <br>third parties who are authorized to receive the credit report and<br> credit score or the specific period of time for which the credit<br> report and credit score are to be available to third parties.         <br>    A consumer credit reporting agency that receives your request to   <br>temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report and credit score is       <br>required to comply with the request within 15 minutes, except after    <br>normal business hours and under certain other conditions, after        <br>receiving your request if you make the request by telephone, or an     <br>electronic method if the agency provides an electronic method, or<br> within three business days after receiving your request if you make<br> the request by mail. The consumer credit reporting agency may charge  <br>you $2 to temporarily lift the freeze.                                 <br>    A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an<br>existing account relationship and a copy of your credit report and     <br>credit score are requested by your existing creditor or its agents or  <br>affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud      <br>control, or similar activities.                                        <br>    If you are actively seeking credit, you should understand that the <br>procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own     <br>applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze,<br> either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a   <br>certain creditor, days before applying for new credit.                 <br>    You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who       <br>violates your rights under these laws on security freezes. The action  <br>can be brought against a consumer credit reporting agency.      <br><p></p>

The applicant may provide the additional information requested, authorize the commissioner to make amendments to the application, or withdraw the application and file a new one to respond to a potential objection or rejection.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As a condition of registration, the commissioner may require the applicant to disclaim an unregisterable component of a mark, or an applicant may voluntarily disclaim a component of a mark originally sought to be registered. A disclaimer under this subsection does not prejudice or affect the rights of an applicant or registrant<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) in the disclaimed matter that exist at the time of the disclaimer or that arise later; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to register the disclaimed matter in another application if the disclaimed matter is or becomes distinctive of the applicant's or registrant's goods or services.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If an applicant is found not to be entitled to registration of a mark, the commissioner shall notify the applicant and inform the applicant of the reasons for the finding. The commissioner shall give the applicant a reasonable period of time in which to reply or amend the application. If a reply or amendment is delivered to the commissioner within the designated period, the commissioner shall reexamine the application. Before making a final decision, an application may be amended and reexamined as many times as the commissioner determines to be necessary. However, if the applicant fails to reply or amend the application within the period designated by the commissioner, the application is considered abandoned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) When the commissioner makes a final decision on the application, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing of the decision and that the decision is final, setting out the reasons for the decision if the application is disapproved. The applicant may appeal the commissioner's final decision to the superior court. The court may enter judgment setting aside, modifying, remanding, or affirming the decision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) If the commissioner receives more than one application for registration of the same or a confusingly similar mark for the same or related goods or services, the commissioner shall grant the registration to the applicant who first filed the original application if the application otherwise qualifies for registration. A rejected applicant may bring an action in superior court for cancellation of the registration upon the grounds of prior or superior rights to the mark.<br><p></p>

If a proceeding is pending or instituted, withdrawal becomes effective at the time and upon the conditions as the administrator by order determines. If a proceeding is not pending or instituted and withdrawal automatically becomes effective, the administrator may nevertheless institute a revocation or suspension proceeding under (a)(2) of this section within one year after withdrawal is effective and enter a revocation or suspension order as of the last date on which registration was effective.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) An order may not be entered under any part of this section except the first sentence of (e) of this section without (1) appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is an agent, (2) opportunity for hearing, and (3) written findings of fact and conclusions of law.
