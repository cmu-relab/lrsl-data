According to California's Office of the Attorney General's website[1] (archived version[2])
State agencies need to follow California Civil Code s. 1798.29
Person or business needs to follow California Civil Code s. 1798.82

The plain text version of both the laws were generated using "plain text copy paste" on the "Printer-Friendly" version and
1. Avoid header information (Division, part, title) including 1798.82 (or 1798.29)
2. Avoid copying the template for breach notification
3. Avoid copying the last line containing the "Amended by" annotation

So the .txt file starts with the first section of the law, i.e. section (a)
