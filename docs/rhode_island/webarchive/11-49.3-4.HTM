  (a)(1) Any municipal agency, state agency, or person that stores, owns, collects, processes, maintains, acquires, uses, or licenses data that includes personal information shall provide notification as set forth in this section of any disclosure of personal information, or any breach of the security of the system, that poses a significant risk of identity theft to any resident of Rhode Island whose personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person or entity. <P>
    (2) The notification shall be made in the most expedient time possible, but no later than forty-five (45) calendar days after confirmation of the breach and the ability to ascertain the information required to fulfill the notice requirements contained in subsection (d) of this section, and shall be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement as provided in subsection (c) of this section. In the event that more than five hundred (500) Rhode Island residents are to be notified, the municipal agency, state agency, or person shall notify the attorney general and the major credit reporting agencies as to the timing, content, and distribution of the notices and the approximate number of affected individuals. Notification to the attorney general and the major credit reporting agencies shall be made without delaying notice to affected Rhode Island residents. <P>
    (b) The notification required by this section may be delayed if a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The federal, state, or local law enforcement agency must notify the municipal agency, state agency, or person of the request to delay notification without unreasonable delay. If notice is delayed due to such determination, then, as soon as the federal, state, or municipal law enforcement agency determines and informs the municipal agency, state agency, or person that notification no longer poses a risk of impeding an investigation, notice shall be provided as soon as practicable pursuant to subsection (a)(2). The municipal agency, state agency, or person shall cooperate with federal, state, or municipal law enforcement in its investigation of any breach of security or unauthorized acquisition or use, which shall include the sharing of information relevant to the incident; provided however, that such disclosure shall not require the disclosure of confidential business information or trade secrets. <P>
    (c) Any municipal agency, state agency, or person required to make notification under this section and fails to do so is liable for a violation as set forth in &sect; 11-49.3-5. <P>
