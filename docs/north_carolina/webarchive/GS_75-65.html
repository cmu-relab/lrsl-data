security breaches.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(a)        Any business that
owns or licenses personal information of residents of North Carolina or any
business that conducts business in North Carolina that owns or licenses
personal information in any form (whether computerized, paper, or otherwise)
shall provide notice to the affected person that there has been a security
breach following discovery or notification of the breach. The disclosure
notification shall be made without unreasonable delay, consistent with the
legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided in subsection (c) of this
section, and consistent with any measures necessary to determine sufficient
contact information, determine the scope of the breach and restore the
reasonable integrity, security, and confidentiality of the data system. For the
purposes of this section, personal information shall not include electronic
identification numbers, electronic mail names or addresses, Internet account
numbers, Internet identification names, parent's legal surname prior to
marriage, or a password unless this information would permit access to a
person's financial account or resources.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(b)        Any business that
maintains or possesses records or data containing personal information of
residents of North Carolina that the business does not own or license, or any
business that conducts business in North Carolina that maintains or possesses
records or data containing personal information that the business does not own
or license shall notify the owner or licensee of the information of any
security breach immediately following discovery of the breach, consistent with
the legitimate needs of law enforcement as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(c)        The notice required
by this section shall be delayed if a law enforcement agency informs the
business that notification may impede a criminal investigation or jeopardize
national or homeland security, provided that such request is made in writing or
the business documents such request contemporaneously in writing, including the
name of the law enforcement officer making the request and the officer's law
enforcement agency engaged in the investigation. The notice required by this
section shall be provided without unreasonable delay after the law enforcement
agency communicates to the business its determination that notice will no
longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national or homeland security.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(d)       The notice shall be
clear and conspicuous. The notice shall include all of the following:</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1)        A description of the
incident in general terms.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2)        A description of the

acquisition.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3)        A description of the
general acts of the business to protect the personal information from further
unauthorized access.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(4)        A telephone number
for the business that the person may call for further information and
assistance, if one exists.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(5)        Advice that directs
the person to remain vigilant by reviewing account statements and monitoring
free credit reports.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(6)        The toll-free
numbers and addresses for the major consumer reporting agencies.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(7)        The toll-free
numbers, addresses, and Web site addresses for the Federal Trade Commission and
the North Carolina Attorney General's Office, along with a statement that the
individual can obtain information from these sources about preventing identity
theft.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(e)        For purposes of
this section, notice to affected persons may be provided by one of the
following methods:</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1)        Written notice.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2)        Electronic notice,

the provisions regarding electronic records and signatures for notices legally
required to be in writing set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 7001.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3)        Telephonic notice
provided that contact is made directly with the affected persons.</span></p>

<p class=aBlock1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(4)        Substitute notice,
if the business demonstrates that the cost of providing notice would exceed two
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or that the affected class of subject
persons to be notified exceeds 500,000, or if the business does not have
sufficient contact information or consent to satisfy subdivisions (1), (2), or
(3) of this subsection, for only those affected persons without sufficient
contact information or consent, or if the business is unable to identify
particular affected persons, for only those unidentifiable affected persons.

business shall notify without unreasonable delay the Consumer Protection
Division of the Attorney General's Office of the nature of the breach, the
number of consumers affected by the breach, steps taken to investigate the breach,
steps taken to prevent a similar breach in the future, and information
regarding the timing, distribution, and content of the notice.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(f)        In the event a
business provides notice to more than 1,000 persons at one time pursuant to
this section, the business shall notify, without unreasonable delay, the
Consumer Protection Division of the Attorney General's Office and all consumer
reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide
basis, as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(p), of the timing, distribution, and
content of the notice.</span></p>

<p class=aMargin1><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(g)        Any waiver of the
provisions of this Article is contrary to public policy and is void and
unenforceable.</span></p>

institution that is subject to and in compliance with the Federal Interagency Guidance
