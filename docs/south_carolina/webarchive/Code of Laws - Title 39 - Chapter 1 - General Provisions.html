	(A) As used in this section, &quot;gift certificate&quot; means a certificate that is issued or sold by a person engaged in the business of offering goods or services for sale at retail and that entitles a recipient of the certificate to the delivery of goods or services from the person who issued or sold the certificate. This term includes a gift card used for the same purpose as a gift certificate.<br /><br />
	(B) A person shall not issue or sell a gift certificate which provides that the certificate expires before the first anniversary of the date on which the certificate is issued or sold. However, a person may issue or sell a gift certificate which provides for an expiration date before the first anniversary of the date on which the certificate is issued or sold as long as the expiration date is on the front of the gift certificate in capitalized letters in at least ten-point font. A gift certificate that contains an expiration date which does not conform to this subsection expires on the first anniversary of the date on which the certificate is issued or sold.<br /><br />
	(C) A condition relating to the use of a gift certificate must be stated clearly on the certificate, the envelope, or covering of the certificate, or the receipt given to the purchaser of the certificate, if the condition provides that the certificate decreases in value over a period of time or that a fee is charged against the balance of the certificate after a certain period of time.<br /><br />

&quot;This act may be cited as the 'Certified Industrial Hygiene and Certified Safety Profession Title Protection Act&quot;'.<br /><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="39-1-90"></a>SECTION 39-1-90.</span> Breach of security of business data; notification; definitions; penalties; exception as to certain banks and financial institutions; notice to Consumer Protection Division.<br /><br />
	(A) A person conducting business in this State, and owning or licensing computerized data or other data that includes personal identifying information, shall disclose a breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data to a resident of this State whose personal identifying information that was not rendered unusable through encryption, redaction, or other methods was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person when the illegal use of the information has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur or use of the information creates a material risk of harm to the resident. The disclosure must be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided in subsection (C), or with measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.<br /><br />
	(B) A person conducting business in this State and maintaining computerized data or other data that includes personal identifying information that the person does not own shall notify the owner or licensee of the information of a breach of the security of the data immediately following discovery, if the personal identifying information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.<br /><br />
	(C) The notification required by this section may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification impedes a criminal investigation. The notification required by this section must be made after the law enforcement agency determines that it no longer compromises the investigation.<br /><br />

			(d) other numbers or information which may be used to access a person's financial accounts or numbers or information issued by a governmental or regulatory entity that uniquely will identify an individual.<br /><br />
		The term does not include information that is lawfully obtained from publicly available information, or from federal, state, or local governmental records lawfully made available to the general public.<br /><br />
	(E) The notice required by this section may be provided by:<br /><br />
		(1) written notice;<br /><br />

		(3) telephonic notice; or<br /><br />

			(b) conspicuous posting of the notice on the web site page of the person, if the person maintains one; or<br /><br />
			(c) notification to major statewide media.<br /><br />
	(F) Notwithstanding subsection (E), a person that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal identifying information and is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of this section is considered to be in compliance with the notification requirements of this section if the person notifies subject persons in accordance with its policies in the event of a breach of security of the system.<br /><br />

	(H) A person who knowingly and wilfully violates this section is subject to an administrative fine in the amount of one thousand dollars for each resident whose information was accessible by reason of the breach, the amount to be decided by the Department of Consumer Affairs.<br /><br />
	(I) This section does not apply to a bank or financial institution that is subject to and in compliance with the privacy and security provision of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.<br /><br />
	(J) A financial institution that is subject to and in compliance with the federal Interagency Guidance Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Consumer Information and Customer Notice, issued March 7, 2005, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, as amended, is considered to be in compliance with this section.<br /><br />
	(K) If a business provides notice to more than one thousand persons at one time pursuant to this section, the business shall notify, without unreasonable delay, the Consumer Protection Division of the Department of Consumer Affairs and all consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on a nationwide basis, as defined in 15 USC Section 1681a(p), of the timing, distribution, and content of the notice.<br /><br />
